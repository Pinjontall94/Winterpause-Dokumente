# 3MT

## Intro

### Relate to a general audience/i.e. why do we care?

-   Abiotic stresses on crops, such as drought or nutrient stress, affect
    millions of people every year to the tune of billions of dollars of lost
    value for farmers, and contribute to rising food prices/lower availability
    for everyone

-   Climate change is projected to worsen these, either directly through
    desertification, or indirectly

-   Strawberry alone is a high value crop (3 billion/yr in the US), with China
    being the largest producer

-   Can't use soil fumigants forever, methyl bromide messes up the ozone (phased
    out in 2016 with the Montreal protocol), and replacements don't work nearly
    as well

### Describe the problem/gap in current understanding

-   The microbiome in a plant's root system and surrounding soil plays an
    important role in the management of these stresses

-   Still mysterious how this all works, but important to find the underlying
    patterns

-   We know from previous research that among other crops, strawberries are able
    to recruit from a pool of existing microbes in the soil to promote systemic
    resistance to disease and increase nutrient uptake

-   Research mostly focused on biotic stress, more in-depth research is needed
    for abiotic stresses

-   Mitigating these without damaging the environment further with pollutants
    like bromine-based fumigants to control will be more important with every
    passing year as we face the effects of climate change

## Research Question

*Why is this the case? Are there certain risk and resilience factors that can
help explain these different trajectories?*

-   Strawberries can indeed recruit helpful microbes from the surrounding soil
    to induce disease resistance

    -   even some significant evidence that this influences nutrient uptake

-   But the mechanism and plasticity of these remain unexplained

-   To figure those out we must first tease out those genotype by environment
    effects. What are those effects?

## Proposed Study

-   Use a cross section of commercial strawberry cultivars that are known to
    genetically distant, grow in the greenhouse

-   Establish treatment and control groups of nutrient and water stresses, and
    one watered and fed normally

-   Within each group, use a variety of soil types and day lengths as the
    dependent variables

-   Establish control pots with no strawberries to represent bulk soil

-   Genotype soil samples by 16s rRNA and cluster into op. taxo units

### Research Goal (What do you hope to find out with this study?)

Goal:

-   determine what patterns, if any, exist between the rhizosphere microbiome
    composition and strawberry drought resistance and nutrient uptake.

-   With this information in hand, we'll have valuable
