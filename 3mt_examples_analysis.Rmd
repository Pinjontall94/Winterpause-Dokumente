# Niamh MacSweeney - Uni Edinburgh - Adolescent Depression 3MT Transcript

## Intro

### Relate to a general audience/i.e. why do we care?

  Our teenage years are a time of immense change. It's a whirlwind for
our biology, our psychology, and our social worlds. Like Dorothy in
The Wizard of Oz, were swept up into this world that we can't quite
comprehend leaving the primary colors of our childhood behind.  We
find ourselves stumbling through a kaleidoscope of bad hair days
troublesome skin and pressure to keep up with the latest airs and
Instagram.

### Describe the problem/gap in current understanding

  However, unlike Dorothy, navigating adolescence is not as simple as
following the yellow brick road.  In fact, it's a time of significant
vulnerability for mental illness, especially depression. Over half of
depression cases emerge by the age of 25, and according to the World
Health Organization, depression is the leading cause of illness and
disability in youth.  Adolescent depression is typically a more severe
form of the disorder, and it's notoriously difficult to treat.  What's
more is that the risk for recurrence increases with each episode
experienced.  After one depressive episode the risk for recurrence is
60%, but by the third episode, this risk has risen to a sobering 90
percent.  So on a closer inspection of this whirlwind it appears that
there are prevailing winds in this direction towards mental illness
that increase in strength with the number of depressive episodes
experienced making it more and more difficult to move back over here
towards well-being. It would also seem that the experience of
depression itself makes some young people more vulnerable to further
depressive episodes, however there are others that only experienced a
single episode of depression.

## Research Question

Why is this the case?  Are there certain risk and resilience factors
that can help explain these different trajectories?

## Proposed Study

To answer these questions, I'll recruit two groups of young people:
one with a history of depression, and another who have never been
depressed. My PhD will examine biological factors like stress response,
psychological factors such as coping styles, as well as social factors
like interpersonal relationships. And it's also really important that
we give young people a voice, so I'll conduct interviews with these
young people, to capture the lived experience of adolescent
depression. 

### Research Goal (What do you hope to find out with this study?)

The goal of this research is to develop novel interventions
so that young people can build long-term resilience against depression
ultimately we want to change the direction of these prevailing winds
allowing young people to pave their own yellow brick road away from
illness and towards health.
