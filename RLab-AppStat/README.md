# RLab Applied Statistics

This directory contains the R scripts supplied from JLU, converted to RMarkdown with minimal changes. The `.md` files listed here are simply links to the real `.Rmd` files, in order to get nicely rendered text on the web:

-   [Intro to R](Introduction%20to%20R-v14-c03.md)
-   [ANOVA](ANOVA-v14-u11.md)
-   [Multiple Comparison and Linear Contrast](Pairwise-Comparison-Linear-Contrast-v14-u22.md)
