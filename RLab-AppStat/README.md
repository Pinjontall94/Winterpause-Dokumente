# RLab Applied Statistics

This directory contains the R scripts supplied from JLU, converted to RMarkdown with minimal changes. The `.md` files listed here are simply links to the real `.Rmd` files, in order to get nicely rendered text on the web:

-   [Intro to R](Introduction-to-R-00.Rmd)
-   [ANOVA](ANOVA-01.Rmd)
-   [Multiple Comparison and Linear Contrast](Pairwise-Comparison-Linear-Contrast-02.Rmd)
